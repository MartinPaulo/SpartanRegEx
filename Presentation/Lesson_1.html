### Slide Respository
* A copy of these slides and sample code is available at: `https://github.com/UoM-ResPlat-DevOps/RegEx`
* A copy of information about HPC at the University of Melbourne is available at `https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au`. See also `man spartan` on the cluster and the `/usr/local/common/` directories for more help and code exammples.
* Help is available at: `hpc-support@unimelb.edu.au`. Other courses also conducted by Research Platforms.
* Terminal projection via https://shellshare.net/

# Part 1: What Are Regular Expressions?
* Regular Expressions ("RegEx") are a general pattern notations that provides the means for efficient and effective text processing. 
* Major initial formal development by Stephen Cole Kleene as a mathematical "Regular Language" in 1951, located as a Type-3 grammar in Chomsky's 1956 hierarchy.
* First major computational use was in 1968 with pattern matching in the QED text editor and, independently in the same year, in compiler design. The regular expression system in QED was ported to `ed` in 1969.
* Main tools for regular expressions are `grep` (1974), `sed` (1974), `awk` (1977), and `perl` (1987).

# Part 1: Metacharacters
* A major feature of RegEx is the use of *metacharacters*, which have a special meaning to the RegEx application over and above their literal meaning. Metacharacters must be escape with a backslash.
* The entire suite of metacharacters that require an escape include: "(", "{" "}", ")", "^", "$", ".", "|", "?", "*", "+", "\".
* In addition to metacharacters there are RegEx classes which convert RegEx ranges into matched set.
* There is a list of sample metacharacter examples and classes in `/usr/local/common/RegEx/basicmeta.md`

# Part 1: Searching with `grep`
* Most basic use is searching text. Typical formal structure is a search for a pattern with Boolean logic, grouping, quantification (e.g., number of instances), and wildcards, followed by an optional operation (arithemetic count, replacement etc) on the pattern. e.g., `grep -i ATEK gattaca.txt`. 
* Common options used with basic `grep` include -i (ignore case), -w (whole words), -v (inverted match), -c (count), -L and -l (print filenames), -n (line number), -r and -R (recursive).
* Examples of `grep` with these characters are available in `/usr/local/common/RegEx/basicgrep.md`

# Part 1: Editing with `sed`
* As the name implies `sed` is a *stream editor*, which means it takes a data stream in a non-interactive mode, conducts a regular expression, and sends it to standard output. 
* The general form is `sed [OPTION] [SCRIPT] [INPUT]`. Common options are `e` (multiple scripts per command), `-f` (add script file) and `-i` (in-place editing).
* The general form of a script is `Command/RegExp/Replacement/Flags`. A common command is `s` for `substitute`, common flags are `g` for global replacement thoughout each line and `I` to ignore case. 
* Examples of `sed` are available at `/usr/local/common/RegEx/basicsed.md`
* Sed has alternative three alternative delimiters in its scripts; '/', ':', or '|'
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* As a data driven programming language `awk` is particularly good at understanding and manipulating text structured by fields - such as tables of rows and columns. 
* The organisation of an `awk` program follows the form: pattern { action }. This is sometimes structured with BEGIN and END which specify actions to be taken before any lines are read, and after the last line is read. 
* The easiest and certainly one of the most common uses of awk is create reports from structured data; columns and rows are referenced by number and by default the space acts as the delimiter.
* Sample `awk` scripts are available at: `/usr/local/common/basicawk.md`, and a collection of `awk` one-liners are at: `http://www.pement.org/awk/awk1line.txt`
